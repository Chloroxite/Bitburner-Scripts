# Bitburner-Scripts
Scripts created during my time playing BitBurner
Bitburner is a terminal themed idle game where the objective is to slowly grow in power by writing scripts to perform hacks on fake hosts. All the scripts here are completely inert outside of the game. Additionally, most of them are outdated in some way, as the last time I played the game was prior to version 2.3.0. If you use these scripts, be sure to update them.
